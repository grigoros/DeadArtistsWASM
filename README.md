# DeadArtistsWASM

Welcome to my Code Louisville C# project!
This Blazor WASM website is a barebones demonstration of my proficiency in the C# programming language,
.NET 6.0, Entity Framework, and the repository-based architecture pattern in web development. The back-end
database is configured to use Microsoft SQL Server and the payment processor is configured to utilize
Stripe webhooks.

This ReadMe will detail how to set up Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, how to seed the SQL database,
how to set up a Stripe account & CLI, and how to utilize a Stripe Web API to checkout & create orders.

My website, Dead Artists, is an e-commerce site specializing in the sale of media produced only by artists
(musicians, film-makers, and writers), who are dead.
